    <p>After most of the building's design was approved, the studio was hired to develop the landscape parts of the project. The landscape intervention could then be divided in 
        four major areas/subjects:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The entrance:</strong> where the existing <em>Licania tomentosa</em> were kept, with minor introductions of smaller vegetations elements, with the spotlight on the 
        <em>Strongylodon macrobotrys</em> planted on a proposed pergola;</li>
        <li><strong>The urban vegetable garden: </strong> where, in spite of a low luminosity spot, we've managed to insert a garden with predominat shadow species, with 
        the focus on the passion fruit (<em>Passiflora edulis</em>);</li>
        <li><strong>The pool: </strong> crowned with two species of palm trees;</li>
        <li><strong>The façade: </strong> proposed by the building's architect and developed by the studio, a living façade with different types of creeping/climber trees that 
        rised up through the balconies</li>
    </ul>
