    <p>The object for this competition was to create what would be the new Central Park for <span lang="pt">Águas Claras</span>, a still seen as dormitory-city in the outskirts of Brasília.
        The area for the new park was cut by streets, avenues and train tracks into many isolated/unconnected blocks, making it the first and foremost challenge for the proposal.
        Besides that, although not stated in the premises for the competition, another challenge was making the project feasible, 
        considering that the amount of funds dedicated to the implementation of the park was seen by all participants as insuficient.
    </p>
    <p>
        Considering the above, the proposal by <a href="https://www.saalmeidapaisagismo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sá & Almeida Paisagismo</a> was to make the center part
         of the existing blocks in a single mass for the park, and it's connections to the other periferical parts through a series of walkways integrated to the new buildings also proposed. 
         Regarding the funding, it was also proposed that two periferical areas of the park would be used as Real Estate Development, so it could mark the entry points to the Central Park Area, 
         besides making available the most needed funds to make it happen.
